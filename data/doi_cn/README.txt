ABSTRACT: Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) weight percent concentrations were obtained from the bulk foliar samples collected across East River, Washington Gulch, Slate River, and Coal Creek watersheds in Gunnison, Colorado during the summer of 2018. These samples were collected from sun-lit leaves of meadow, shrub, and tree vegetation types within 72 hours of the National Ecological Observatory Network Airborne Observation Platform (NEON AOP) hyperspectral survey. These samples were dried and then run on an elemental analyzer coupled to a mass spectrometer for C and N concentrations and delta13C. The intention of these data were to provide ground truth data to develop foliar nutrient models across the imaging spectroscopy domain. Additional associated site metadata and vegetation fractional cover information can be found in the associated data releases (DOI: 10.15485/1618130). Here we provide site level C, N, and delta 13C data in the CN_Results_Foliar.csv. All of these samples were also registered with IGSN codes, and the details from that registration with metadata for the samples is included in foliar_sample_igsn_metadata.csv.
