ABSTRACT: Locations and descriptions of the sites where field sampling was conducted during the 2018 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) imaging spectroscopy and lidar surveys in Gunnison County, Colorado. The sampling sites were located across East River, Washington Gulch, Slate River, and Coal Creek watersheds and contained a mixture of meadow, shrub, and tree sampling sites. This data package contains the location, metadata, species composition, and vector files for the sampling sites in this project. Species vouchers that have been preserved in the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory herbarium can be found on the Consortia of Southern Rocky Mountain Herbaria website: http://soroherbaria.org/portal/collections/index.php. Vector files provided here are for areas delineated based on the AOP reflectance data and mosaic developed by Brodrick et al. (doi: 10.15485/1618131), and use with other datasets should be closely evaluated. Subsequent data packages will contain additional biogeochemical, microbial, and geophysical data as they become available for these sampling sites. For full documentation, please see associated reference and additional references will be added here as they become available.
