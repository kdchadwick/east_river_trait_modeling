This reposiotry handles the management and merging of NEON AOP remote sensing data with field/lab-based trait data.
The code leverages a plsr ensembling routine (external to this repository) to create trait models and assess the
model performance.  This code was created as part of an effort to generate foliar trait maps throughout the Department of Energy (DOE) Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (WF-SFA) site in Crested Butte, CO in association with NEON's Assignable Asset program.
