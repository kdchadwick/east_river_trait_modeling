ABSTRACT: Leaf area, wet, and dry weights for leaf samples from sites where field sampling was conducted during the 2018 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) Airborne Observation Platform (AOP) imaging spectroscopy and lidar surveys in Gunnison County, Colorado. The sampling sites were located across East River, Washington Gulch, Slate River, and Coal Creek watersheds and contained a mixture of meadow, shrub, and tree sampling sites. This data package contains the leaf area and wet and dry weights for leaves from tree and shrub sampling sites, as well as samples for meadow species present within a given sampling area. Associated data packages contain species composition information at the plot level (DOI: 10.15485/1618130), as well as additional biogeochemical, microbial, and geophysical data as they become available. For full documentation, please see associated reference.

This package contains zipped folders of all scans that were used for area calculations for both sampling sites (tree/shrub, site_scans.zip) as well as representative samples from a daily sampling area of meadow species that were found in the 1 m plots (meadow_area_scans.zip). It also contains the macro code that was used in ImageJ for processing of the area calculations. Finally, it includes excel files with the area (cm2), wet weight (g), dry weight (g), leaf mass per area (LMA, g/m2), and leaf water content (%) for each set of scans.
