This reposiotry handles the management and merging of NEON AOP remote sensing data with field/lab-based trait data.
The code leverages a plsr ensembling routine (external to this repository) to create trait models and assess the
model performance.  This code was created as part of an effort to 
generate foliar trait maps throughout the Department of Energy (DOE) Watershed Function Special Focus Area (WF-FSA).
A full description of the effort can be found at:
